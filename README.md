# LMG: Opportunities
Our work involves finding ways to improve on the LogGen model used by CC2Vec towards generating better log messages
Our lines of work are as follows:
1. Improving the dataset
2. Reduce anisotropy in embedding space of vectors: Incorporating context of code changes in CC2Vec embedded vectors
3. For an unknown code change, summarize top k most similar code changes into a single output log message 
4. Improving the evaluation metric used for assessing quality of test data log messages
